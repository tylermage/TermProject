ITM 360: Gila Breath Camp Application. My team and I throughout the semester created a Camper Applicaiton Verfication form and Search. Ealier in the semester we had one prototype model that just had th basic check boxes and word boxes. Our final product includes much of what the previous application had but now includes a database with a search function. 
Our Key compenents includeds taking individual items and  compiling them into a bigger category. This makes it easier for the registration clerk. If a camper says no then the clerk will access another form saying which exact itmes they're missing. If the camper puts yes, no other information would need to be displayed.
For the new code, we had to cretae a database file that saves all the camper information onto a file. You can acess the database with a search and query function. This allows the clerk to pull up information as needed.
Some issues we had with the code was adding a new drop down menue. We also had a query fucntion at first which we then fixed. Missing camper information would previously cause an error.
